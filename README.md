### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on theoretical particle physics and moving towards the interface with explainable/stable AI
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AI frameworks by reproducing the results of this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10802
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on explainable AI and AI alignment combined with ideas from physics
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with writting nice python code (I am putting down my physecist style ;) ) 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Drop an email to philipp.a.kreer@tum.de
- âš¡ Fun fact: After I finished highschool I took my backpack and hiked 1600 km through France and Spain.
