### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a theoretical particle physicist with interest in explainable and robust AI systems. My reasearch interests are twofold: On hand I apply the framework of particle physics to compute precision predictions for experiments at the Large Hadron Collider in CERN. On the other hand the same mathematical framework can be used to analyze various AI models (e.g. neurel networks, convolutional neurel networks, or GPT-like transformer architectures). The repository QFT-AI is an example. QFT stands for Quantum Field Theory which is the mathematical framework of particle physics. In this repository, I am reprodcing the experiments of this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10802). 

**Public Repositories:**

- TTH: Mathematica package to evaluate the scattering amplitude $gg\to t\overline{t}H$, published in the [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10015).
- QFT_AI: Implementation of experiments conducting in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.10802).
- arXiv-filter: A customizeable filter for daily publications.
