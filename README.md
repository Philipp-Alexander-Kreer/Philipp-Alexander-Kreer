# Philipp Alexander Kreer: Physicist and AI Aligner 👋

I am an interdisciplinary Ph.D. researcher in theoretical physics at the Technical University of Munich and an APART Research Fellow in AI alignment. My work focuses on applying Quantum Field Theory (QFT) to both particle physics and the analysis of AI architectures, aiming to develop trustworthy AI systems. I am in the last year of my Ph.D., expecting to finish in July 2025.

### 🔬 Research Interests  
- **Particle Physics**: Precision computations for the LHC using QFT and renormalization techniques.  
- **AI & Machine Learning**: Applying **physics-inspired methods** to improve **interpretability, robustness, and alignment** in AI systems.  
- **Singular Learning Theory (SLT)**: Investigating **generalization properties and phase transitions** in AI models.  

### 📂 Selected Projects  
- [TTH](https://github.com/p-a-kreer/TTH) – Fast computation of Higgs-top quark interactions, published in JHEP.  
- [QFT_AI](https://github.com/p-a-kreer/QFT_AI) – Exploring neural network properties using QFT-inspired techniques.  
- [SandbagDetect](https://github.com/camtice/SandbagDetect) – Detecting strategic underperformance in LLMs (NeurIPS 2024).  
- [arXiv_filter](https://github.com/p-a-kreer/arXiv_filter) – A customizable filter for daily arXiv updates.
