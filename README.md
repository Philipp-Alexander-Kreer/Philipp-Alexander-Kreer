### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a theoretical particle physicist at the Technical University of Munich with interest in explainable and robust AI systems. 

**:scientist: Research Interests:**

On hand I apply Quantum Field Theory (QFT) the framework of modern particle physics to compute precision predictions for experiments at the Large Hadron Collider in CERN. On the other, I use the same framework to analyze AI architectures (e.g. neurel networks, convolutional neurel networks, or GPT-like transformer architectures). The repository [QFT_AI](https://github.com/p-a-kreer/QFT_AI), see also  [Neurel Networks and Quantum Field Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08601.pdf), is an example of how these two fields are connected. 

In combination with [The Principles of Deep Learning Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10165), I am investigating the possibility to approximate the function [TTH](https://github.com/p-a-kreer/TTH), see [One loop QCD corrections to ggâ†’ttH at O(Îµ2)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10015), with a machine learning approach. A successful implementtation would faciliate precision predictions for a large range of experiments conducted at the Large Hadron Collider. The AI is sensitive to singular points and branch cuts (= jumps in the imaginary part) in the function TTH, which makes the training and feature engeneering challenging. However, these chritical regions have a clear physical interpreation and QFT allows a precise description of these regions, making this problem to an opportunity to develop robust AI systems.
