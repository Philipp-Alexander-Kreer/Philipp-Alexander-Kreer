### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a theoretical particle physicist with interest in explainable and robust AI systems. My reasearch interests are twofold: On hand I apply Quantum Field Theory (QFT) the framework of modern particle physics to compute precision predictions for experiments at the Large Hadron Collider in CERN. On the other hand the same mathematical framework can be used to analyze various AI models (e.g. neurel networks, convolutional neurel networks, or GPT-like transformer architectures). The repository QFT-AI, see below, gives an example on the interaction between these two fields. 

Currently, I am investigate the possibility to approximate the function TTH, see corresponding repository and [my paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10015), with a neurel network. A successful implementtation would faciliate precision predictions for experiments at the Large Hadron Collider. 
On the theoretical side, I am studying how the framework [Neurel Networks and Quantum Field Theory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.08601.pdf) can be used to make transparent the calculations done in [The Principles of Deep Learning Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10165)
